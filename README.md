# Spotify Clone 

This project is a simplified clone of the Spotify web interface, built using React. It aims to replicate the core functionalities and UI elements of Spotify, providing a learning experience for front-end development, particularly in React.

## Features

* **Basic UI Layout:** Replicates the main layout of Spotify's web player, including the sidebar, main content area, and bottom player controls.
* **Dummy Data Integration:** Uses placeholder or dummy data to simulate playlists, songs, and artists.
* **React Components:** Demonstrates the use of React components for building a modular and maintainable UI.
* **Simple Playback Simulation:** Basic controls for play, pause, and track navigation (without actual audio playback).
* **Responsive Design:** Attempts to provide a responsive layout for different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

* **CSS (or Styled-Components, Sass, etc.):** For styling the application.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For application logic.
